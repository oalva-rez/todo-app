# To-Do App
<p>This To-Do App was a result of further learning a modular/component approach back-boning on SOLID principles. This To-Do App allows you to add new tasks and filter
  them by 'All/Home', 'Today', 'This Week'. I also implemented the feature of being able to change the dates of the tasks after creation and reflecting the change accordingly.
  This App allows you to create projects that hold sub tasks which also are shown and filtered by their respective home tab.</p>
  <h2>Getting Started</h2>
  <h3>Prerequisites</h3>
  <li>A web browser of your choice with JavaScript enabled.</li>
  <h3>Track your resposibilites</h3>
  <a href="">Live Version</a>
  <h3>Learning Outcomes</h3>
  <p>As a result of learning about NPM and different package managers, I created this project utilizing webpack as a way to bundle and streamline all my assets
  to an output file. This gave me the opportunity to install and use the date-fns library to filter out to-do tasks depeding on their due date. This also showed me
  the endless libraries made to make my development process easier.
  <p>This project was crucial to understanding what it means to write reproducable code. In hindsight, I would completely seperate all 
  DOM manipulation with app mechanics into their own seperate components. I would also add all task functionality within its own constructor prototype to ease the addition
    of future features.</p>
